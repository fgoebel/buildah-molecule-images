# buildah-molecule-images

Makefile-based creation of container images with buildah and podman
for automated testing of ansible roles with molecule.

## Supported Platforms

Any linux platform podman and buildah run on.

I use it on Manjaro (based on Archlinux).

## Dependencies

* bash
* buildah
* GNU make
* GNU parallel (optional)
* podman

### Podman settings
apt based images require 65536 subuid and subgid, set `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` like

```bash
yourusername:165536:65536
```

## Usage

TODO

## Examples

### Build all images and push to container registry

```shell
make all
make push
```

### Build all images in parallel

```shell
make parallel
```

### Build all images of a distribution

For example, to build all Debian images and push them:

```shell
make debian
make push
```

### Build a single image (CentOS 8) and push it to container registry

Call the build script directly:

```shell
./images/centos/8
make push
```
